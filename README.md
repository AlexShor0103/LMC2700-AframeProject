 As per assignment description: "Find a 2D photograph or painting and turn in into a 3D scene using Aframe. (Note: You must find the original image, not create it yourself.) You may choose any kind or style of image: abstract or representational photos/paintings are equally acceptable.  a. If you are completely new to Aframe and 3D, you may want to choose something abstract and geometrical. For example: https://www.artsy.net/artist/piet-mondrian (Links to an external site.). But You can also choose a representational painting from an earlier period, such as the Renaissance.  b. You do not have choose a painting or art work as a model. It could be a photograph, for example, of a room of furniture, such as these: https://m2.ikea.com/us/en/rooms/dining/ (Links to an external site.)  In making your scene, you can use any combination of 2D and 3D graphic elements, text, panoramic images or environment, and even videos.
